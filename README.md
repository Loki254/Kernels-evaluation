# Kernels-evaluation
An evaluaton of 3 SVM kernel functions
The kernel function is very important when it comes to supporting vector machine classification. 
However, it can be hard to choose the best kernel based on the available alternatives due to the complexity of the problem. 
Although kernel methods have been widely used in machine learning, identifying the best ones among the given kernels is important to their success. 
This project presents a comparative evaluation of three kernel functions of the SVM algorithm; radial basis function, sigmoid function, and polynomial function. 
Evaluation of performance is done to ascertain their general performance. 
The experiments have been conducted on a multi-classification problem.
